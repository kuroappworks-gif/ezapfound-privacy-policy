    <h1>ezapfound Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the "ezapfound" software application (hereinafter referred to as the "App") for mobile devices, created by KURO APP WORKS. The App is a simple home launcher designed to help users organize installed apps and create quick-access shortcuts for important contacts.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Provided by the User</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on our servers. However, users can manually enter the following information, which is <strong>stored locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact Shortcut Information:</strong> Names and phone numbers provided by the user for the purpose of creating SOS/contact shortcuts. This data is used solely to enable the "One-Tap Dial" function.</li>
        <li><strong>Reminder/Calendar Information:</strong> Titles, details, dates, times, and color settings for schedules created by the user. This data is used solely for the reminder notification and calendar display functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information / Non-Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The App collects and stores the following data <strong>locally on your device</strong> solely to provide the core functions of the launcher:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Installed App Information:</strong> Package names, app labels (display names), and installation dates/times of apps installed on the device.</li>
        <li><strong>User Settings and Preferences:</strong> Configuration data such as category names, app organization/order, theme/font size settings, and background image URIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Data:</strong> When the backup function is used, a JSON file containing category and app placement information is created on the device's storage based on the user's instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The locally stored data mentioned above is never sent to our servers or any third parties, except where required by the third-party services described in Section 4.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. Permissions Used and Their Purposes</h2>
    <p>The App requires the following permissions and uses them only for the stated purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>:</strong> Required for displaying advertisements and managing consent.</li>
        <li><strong><code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code>:</strong> Required for the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) for advertising and analytics purposes.</li>
        <li><strong><code>android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO</code>:</strong> Used only when the user voluntarily taps the voice search/microphone icon. Audio data is processed by the device's standard voice recognition service and is not recorded or stored by the App.</li>
        <li><strong><code>android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</code>:</strong> Used to trigger reminders set by the user at the exact specified time.</li>
        <li><strong><code>android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT</code>:</strong> Used to display full-screen alerts for important reminders (e.g., medication or appointments), ensuring they are conveyed even when the device is locked.</li>
        <li><strong><code>android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code>:</strong> Used to display notifications from the app (reminders and alarms).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party service providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For advertisement delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK:</strong> To manage user consent for personalized advertising (GDPR/CCPA compliant).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services may collect information for purposes such as personalized ad delivery, frequency capping, and ad reporting. For more details, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>All locally generated data (app lists, categories, reminders, settings) remains on the user's device until the App is uninstalled or the user manually deletes the data. Backup files created by the user may remain in the device's storage after uninstallation and must be deleted manually.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is designed for a general audience and does not knowingly collect data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
